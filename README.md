### Hi! My name is Brett Wolmarans, and ðŸ‘‹ thank you for stopping by ðŸ‘‹ 

Some background can be found on my LinkedIn profile [https://www.linkedin.com/in/%E2%98%95-brett-wolmarans-8b6907/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brett-wolmarans-8b6907/) but what you really need to know is I left a suitcase full of early tmnj and xmen comics in a storage locker in Richmond, Virginia 34 years ago.

- ðŸ”­ Like my garage, I plan on organizing my repos tomorrow.  So check back then!
- You are mostly going to find sample code, forgotten side-projects, and old code here. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on security testing tools
- ðŸ’¬ The good stuff is private but happy to share and collaborate
